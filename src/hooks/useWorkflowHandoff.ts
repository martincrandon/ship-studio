/**
 * Delivers a queued "Send to agent" prompt once the project is open.
 *
 * Delivery is a *spawn*, not a paste. The prompt becomes the agent CLI's
 * opening argument in a brand-new tab, which is the only way it cannot be
 * lost: it is in the process's argv before the agent starts, so there is no
 * window where the terminal exists but the CLI is not yet listening, and
 * nothing has to press Return afterwards.
 *
 * The previous approach typed into whichever terminal happened to be active.
 * It failed in three ways at once — the paste landed while the CLI was still
 * booting and was swallowed; when it did survive it sat unsent in the input
 * box; and if the tab was mid-conversation it interrupted it.
 *
 * Opening a project is still several seconds of mounting and seeding, so this
 * waits for the terminal system to be ready for that project before asking for
 * the tab, and gives up rather than leaving a timer running for the session.
