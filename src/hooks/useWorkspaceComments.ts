/**
 * The workspace side of leaving a comment.
 *
 * Comments used to have their own header toggle and their own floating panel.
 * They do not any more: a comment lives in Team → Comments, and *that* tab
 * being open is what arms clicking an element in the preview. One door, one
 * list, one place a note can be.
 *
 * What is left here is the side effect that door still needs. Placing a comment
 * means clicking the live preview, so opening the tab brings the preview
 * forward and starts the dev server — the same thing the Variables panel does
 * for the same reason.
